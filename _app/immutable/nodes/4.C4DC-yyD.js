Kru Kanya, the last Lakhon Chatri performer, said she wants to leave something tangible. That is why we made 3D printed toys inspired by the drama&#39;s dresses. Those toys will also be given to the community children to let them know the culture and where those objects come from. Then, the abstract digital effects that move in time with the drama&#39;s music are inspired by it and reflect the fact that, in the past, Nang Loeng had a very lively night life.</p> <p class="py-2"><b>Artists</b>: Gianluca Rubino and Sutapat Putnoi (Prim)</p> <p class="py-2">Exhibited at <b>Bangkok 1899</b> (134 Nakhon Sawan Road, Wat Sommanat, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok, Thailand 10100).</p> <p class="py-2">See the digital effects only via the <a class="anchor" href="https://freccialata.github.io/lakhon-chatri-artech/" target="_blank">GitHub page</a> (the same used during the exhibition).</p> <h3 class="h3 py-4">Press</h3> <ul><li>Watch the project <a class="anchor" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSsAf9C3HMo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roundup and interviews</a>.</li> <li>Read the article on <a class="anchor" href="https://bangkok1899.org/artech-exhibition" target="_blank">Bangkok 1899&#39;s blog</a>.</li></ul>`;return{c(){t=b(),e=y("article"),e.innerHTML=i,this.h()},l(a){d("svelte-20y4t4",document.head).forEach(s),t=g(a),e=u(a,"ARTICLE",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),f(e)!=="svelte-1ooot82"&&(e.innerHTML=i),this.h()},h(){document.title="Dreaming of Nang Loeng | Gianluca Rubino",p(e,"class","max-w-3xl")},m(a,n){r(a,t,n),r(a,e,n)},p:o,i:o,o,d(a){a&&(s(t),s(e))}}}class T extends c{constructor(t){super(),m(this,t,null,v,l,{})}}export{T as component};
